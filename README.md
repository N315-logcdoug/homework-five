For this fifth assignment, Logan and I (Tom Tran - study leader) have created and implemented this website called "The BookNook" from the Adobe XD prototype. There, we had used:

- HTML, CSS, and JS, but not limited to--
- Web and mobile responsiveness
- Constructing MVC model
- SCSS
- An habit of using the GitHub Desktop to fetch origin
- Commit the code with collaboration
